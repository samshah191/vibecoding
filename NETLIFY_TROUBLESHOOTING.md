# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## VibeCoding Platform - Automated Deployment

### Current Configuration ✅

The VibeCoding platform is now configured with:

1. **Optimized Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)
   - Direct build commands without dependencies on root scripts
   - Node.js 18 enforcement
   - Legacy peer deps support
   - Disabled CI mode for compatibility

2. **Build Environment Files**
   - `.nvmrc` - Ensures Node 18 usage
   - `.npmrc` - Configures npm behavior
   - `netlify-build.sh` - Custom build script

3. **Environment Variables Setup**
   You'll need to set these in Netlify Dashboard:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

### If Deployment Still Fails:

#### Step 1: Check Build Logs
Look for specific error messages in the "Why did it fail?" section.

#### Step 2: Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Module not found" or dependency errors**
- Solution: The `.npmrc` file should handle this with `legacy-peer-deps=true`

**Issue: "Out of memory" during build**
- Solution: Contact Netlify support to increase build memory limit

**Issue: Environment variables missing**
- Solution: Set environment variables in Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables

**Issue: TypeScript compilation errors**
- Solution: The build uses `CI=false` to treat warnings as non-fatal

#### Step 3: Alternative Build Command
If the custom script fails, you can try this simpler command in Netlify:
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps && cd client && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
```

### Manual Deployment Test

You can test the build locally:
```bash
# In the project root
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cd client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```

This should create `client/dist` folder with the deployable files.

### Contact Support

If issues persist, the problem might be:
1. Netlify account limits
2. GitHub repository permissions
3. Build environment specific issues

The automated deployment is designed to work without manual intervention, aligning with your preference for hands-off technical management.
